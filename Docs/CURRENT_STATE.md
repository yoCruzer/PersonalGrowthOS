## Authoritative Product Baseline

The Foundation Documents in `Docs/INDEX.md` remain authoritative. `Docs/V1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` defines the completed S1–S10 delivery. The Owner-approved 2026-07-31 Completion Push adds only lightweight manual Weight records to V1; it does not introduce a separate health product.

The previously verified `fix/v1-device-smoke-round1` commit `dd09975` passed Internal TestFlight installation and the first Owner-supplied iPhone smoke test. It was safely fast-forwarded to `main` before the isolated `feature/v1-completion-push` branch was created. `main` remains unchanged; the V1 distribution branch and the newer S2 branch remain unmerged.

## Build 6 Owner Feedback Round 1

Build 6 starts from the clean Build 5 handoff `1a1f6bb` and keeps SwiftData schema V7 and backup schema v3 unchanged. Implementation commit `48b324c` completes the bounded owner-feedback scope:

- Library now provides Weekly Review history and Search; history and search reopen the exact stored calendar week, and search covers all four WeeklyReview text fields including Chinese content.
- Weekly Review uses a persisted edit baseline: unchanged Save is disabled, edits show Unsaved changes, successful save briefly shows Saved, and a cancellable task prevents stale feedback from overwriting newer edits.
- The factual weekly summary uses a compact adaptive Your Week block. The exact adjacent week’s focus appears as Last Week’s Focus in the review and This Week’s Focus on Today.
- Full-screen Entry images are centered independently of the top-right Close overlay. The repeatable Habit control is one capsule with one count and 44-point decrement/increment targets.
- The draggable Search/Capture cluster and coordinate logic are removed. A fixed bottom-center Quick Capture action sits between the four native tabs, while Search is available from Library.
- Settings includes opt-in daily recording and weekly review local reminders. Stable identifiers replace pending requests deterministically; notification permission is requested only from an enable action, and denied authorization exposes an iOS Settings path.
- New user-visible strings have English and Simplified Chinese values.

Final simulator evidence on iPhone 16, iOS 26.5 (`5F04DE28-8329-4774-9488-076D6DDC5230`):

- Debug build: PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build6-FinalBuild2.xcresult`.
- Focused Unit tests: 39/39 — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build6-Focused3.xcresult`.
- Full Unit suite: 146/146 — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build6-FinalUnit.xcresult`.
- Focused changed-flow UI tests: 5/5 — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build6-FinalUI2.xcresult`.
- JSON parsing, bilingual catalog completeness, conflict-marker scan and `git diff --check`: PASS.

Physical-device validation is still required for portrait/landscape image centering; bottom capture safe-area placement; Habit pill layout and tap comfort; notification permission allow/deny, rescheduling, relaunch and actual delivery; Chinese Weekly Review input/save/fade/relaunch; and focus visibility across a real calendar-week boundary. No Build 6 TestFlight, archive or device PASS is claimed.

## Post-V1 Usability S2

The active branch starts from the formal App icon refresh at `c45c666`. It retains two committed but previously unpushed UX fixes: `53f2326` unifies the empty-state and toolbar add actions for Weight and Habits, and `06cc913` makes multiple-per-day Habit counters directly reversible. The current S2 candidate adds a manual weekly review/action loop; its scope and evidence are recorded in `Docs/USABILITY_S2_REVIEW_LOOP.md`.

S2 adds a V7 SwiftData schema containing one manually created `WeeklyReview` per natural calendar week. The week policy is Gregorian, Monday-first and four-day-first-week, while retaining the local device time zone for local-day semantics; Locale, Region and a non-Gregorian system calendar do not alter review identity. It does not alter `EntryKind.review`, generate reports, create tasks, add health advice, or widen the V1 product model. A user can explicitly begin a weekly review from Today, see a local summary of that week’s Entries, HabitLogs, Weight and Tags, write optional reflection/next-step/focus text, save it locally and reopen it after relaunch. Full backup schema v3 preserves these records while v1/v2 packages remain importable when they contain no weekly-review data.

The focused PR review fix keeps once-per-day Habit Undo unchanged. Multiple-per-day Habits instead use only the immediate +/- counter: minus removes today's latest structured `HabitLog` and never deletes a linked Entry or its explicit Entry-to-Habit relation. Detail and Insight check-ins in that mode no longer show the competing Undo bar.

Draft PR #2 has passed its first independent code review. The S2 device-validation candidate was Version 1.0 (Build 4), prepared from `bacb504afb30c582c869ae68f8558831c5067437` at `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-S2-Build4.xcarchive`. Local Archive inspection confirmed the Release arm64 app, bundle identifier `com.yocruzer.PersonalGrowthOS`, display name `随心log`, AppIcon, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO`, and Team `83SKX2PM7B`. Build 4 was subsequently distributed through TestFlight and physically validated by the Owner.

Build 4 Owner iPhone overlay validation passed V5→V6→V7 migration; preservation/relaunch of original Entry, image, Habit, Goal and Review data; Weight persistence; repeatable-Habit `+++--`; Insight→`+`→`-` linked-Entry retention; explicit-only Weekly Review creation; and V7 export. It found a P0 Weekly Review closure failure: Chinese keyboard dismissal was unreliable and Save gave no visible confirmation or persistence proof. The post-`2084207` candidate now gives Review fields explicit focus and a keyboard Done action, yields before saving, refetches the stable current-week review rather than relying on a potentially stale query snapshot, and makes success/failure visible. It also clears stale success feedback when any editable field, including completion, changes or when a new save begins; a focused UI test covers completion-state save/relaunch persistence. It compacts the repeatable-Habit counter, makes the floating Search/Capture cluster keyboard-aware, draggable and locally persisted, and closes the two bounded Entry-media UX debts.

Version 1.0 (Build 5) was archived from source commit `6027d758c5d18183a3aacae75ef8e1b3f8dc6d0b` at `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-S2-Build5.xcarchive`. Inspection confirmed the Release arm64 app, bundle identifier `com.yocruzer.PersonalGrowthOS`, display name `随心log`, formal AppIcon resources, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO`, Team `83SKX2PM7B`, and successful `codesign --verify --deep --strict`. The Archive is recognized as scheme `PersonalGrowthOS` by Organizer metadata. It has not been uploaded to App Store Connect/TestFlight, and Build 5 Owner device validation has not been executed; PR #2 remains Draft.

## V1 Final Candidate

The candidate provides:

- Rich local Entry capture with text, 0–9 original images, dates, editing, archive, restore and permanent delete.
- Today, Timeline, Growth and Library with global Quick Capture and Search.
- Inbox, All Entries, Tags and Archived organization.
- Structured Habit lifecycle and HabitLog check-ins.
- Goal and Flag lifecycle with bounded relationships.
- Lightweight manual Review Entries using the shared Entry lifecycle.
- Complete unencrypted ZIP export and safe empty-store import.
- English and Simplified Chinese interface.
- Lightweight Weight CRUD, dates, kilograms, latest value, previous-record change, simple chart, history, Today/Growth entry points and restart persistence.

No approved V1 capability remains unimplemented. UX-01 and UX-02 are resolved in the Build 5 candidate without expanding into a media-browser redesign.

## Persistence and Migration Safety

SwiftData schema V6 adds `WeightRecord`; schema V7 adds `WeeklyReview`. The explicit V5→V6 and V6→V7 lightweight migrations do not rename, remove or tighten fields on existing Entry, ImageMetadata, Tag, ObjectLink, Habit, HabitLog, HabitConfiguration, Goal, GoalLifecycleEvent or WeightRecord data.

Automated migration coverage creates an on-disk V5 store with representative Entry, Habit and Goal data, opens it through V6 and verifies identities and representative fields while Weight starts empty. Separate V6→V7 coverage verifies existing Entry, Habit and Weight records remain unchanged while WeeklyReview starts empty. Existing migration and recovery tests cover earlier schemas, relationship integrity and media boundaries.

Full backup package schema v3 includes Weight and WeeklyReview. The importer accepts valid schema-v1, v2 and v3 packages, rejects Weight in v1 and WeeklyReview in v1/v2, validates v3 weekly-review identity, timestamps and period ordering, and preserves all supported records through round trip. Original image bytes remain in the private media tree rather than SwiftData. There is no destructive store-rebuild or empty-store fallback after migration failure.

The Owner executed the V5→V6→V7 overlay against the existing iPhone store on Build 4 and confirmed preservation and restart recovery. The remaining physical-device gate is Build 5 revalidation of the Weekly Review Chinese input/save/relaunch closure and the new bounded interaction polish.

## Final Automated Validation

Executed on iPhone 16 Simulator, iOS 26.5 (`5F04DE28-8329-4774-9488-076D6DDC5230`):

- Simulator Debug Build: PASS.
- Full Unit Tests: 125/125 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Full UI Tests: 22/22 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Combined automated total: 147/147 passed.
- Import/export, recovery, media, migration and Weight tests are included in the full Unit suite.
- English build-for-testing: PASS.
- Simplified Chinese build-for-testing: PASS.
- String Catalog JSON and bilingual-value validation: PASS (285 keys).
- Xcode project parsing, target/scheme references and Release build settings: PASS.
- `git diff --check` and merge-conflict-marker scan: PASS.

Result bundles:

- Debug Build: `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3-Debug.xcresult`
- Unit: `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3-Unit.xcresult`
- UI: `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3-UI.xcresult`
- English: `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3-English.xcresult`
- Simplified Chinese: `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3-ZhHans.xcresult`

Xcode emitted environment-only warnings while copying signed XCTest support binaries and resolving the LLDB debugger version for UI launches. They produced no build or test failure.

## Formal App Icon Refresh

The App icon for the existing desktop display name `随心log` now uses a warm ivory Möbius band with two restrained terracotta record nodes on a low-saturation deep teal background. The existing universal iOS 1024×1024 `AppIcon` slot remains in use; the source PNG is RGB with no alpha channel, and no Bundle Identifier, signing, version, build number or display-name setting changed.

The refreshed asset passed Asset Catalog compilation and a Debug build on the iPhone 16 Simulator running iOS 26.5. Simulator inspection covered the Home Screen in light and dark appearance, App Library and Spotlight; the icon remained legible and showed no white edge, transparent edge, double rounding, stretching, clipping or visible blur. The existing focused app-shell UI launch smoke test also passed.

## Build 3 and Distribution

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Marketing Version | `1.0` |
| CFBundleVersion | `3` |
| Bundle Identifier | `com.yocruzer.PersonalGrowthOS` |
| Team | `83SKX2PM7B` |
| Signing style | Automatic |
| Export compliance | `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` |
| Archive | PASS for the pre-icon candidate; regeneration required to include the formal icon |
| Archive path | `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-V1Final-Build3.xcarchive` |
| Local archive metadata inspection | PASS |
| App Store Connect export | BLOCKED — `No Accounts`; no `iOS Distribution` certificate |
| Server-side validation | NOT EXECUTED |
| Upload | NOT EXECUTED |
| App Store Connect processing | NOT STARTED |
| Internal Testing | NOT AVAILABLE FOR BUILD 3 |

The existing Archive is a normal Automatic Signing development-signed intermediate, but it predates the formal App icon refresh and must not be uploaded as the refreshed candidate. Regenerate Build 3 from the current branch tip, then use Xcode signed in to the correct Apple account to export it with App Store distribution signing and upload it. The in-app App Store Connect browser session was also unauthenticated.

## Quality State

- Known P0: none in the Build 6 simulator candidate.
- Known P1: none.
- Known new product P2: none.
- Open non-blocking P2: none from this feedback batch; UX-01 and UX-02 are resolved in `Docs/UX_DEBT.md`.
- Build 4 Owner-data overlay remains historically passed; Build 6 physical-device validation and any TestFlight distribution remain unclaimed.

## Next Action

Review [Draft PR #3](https://github.com/yoCruzer/PersonalGrowthOS/pull/3) against `feature/usability-s2-review-loop`. After review, the Owner decides whether to create a TestFlight build and perform the listed physical-device checks. Do not merge or publish automatically. The V1 Build 3 distribution handoff remains separate and Owner-only on `feature/v1-completion-push`.
