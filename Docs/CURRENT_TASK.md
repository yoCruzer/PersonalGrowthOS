| --- | --- |
| Current checkpoint | V1 Autonomous Build Program — S1 Entry Domain Foundation |
| Status | State 3 — Program Authorized / Running |
| Owner startup authorization | Granted on 2026-07-18 by the explicit V1 Autonomous Build Program startup instruction |
| Program baseline | `b82d6e656592663f679440e318d00bef06f50556` |
| Execution branch | `feat/v1-autonomous-build` |
| Authorized coverage | Macro Stages S1–S10 |
| Current Macro Stage | S1 — Entry Domain Foundation |

## Objective

Autonomously implement, validate and commit Macro Stages S1–S10 on the isolated execution branch, producing an Owner-reviewable V1 Candidate.

The immediate objective is S1: define the minimum stable Entry concepts, value rules, validation and business behavior without creating a second field-complete Entry model.

## Scope

- Execute S1–S10 according to `Docs/V1_AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `Docs/V1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Keep every Macro Stage as an engineering, validation, status and Commit boundary.
- Maintain `Docs/V1_AUTONOMOUS_STATUS.md` throughout execution.
- Use the Autonomous Candidate Technical Gate for Stage continuation.
- Stop only at successful Candidate completion or a Mandatory Escalation condition.

## Constraints

- All product implementation must remain on `feat/v1-autonomous-build`.
- Preserve the Foundation Documents and `DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.md`.
- Do not add V2 capabilities, third-party dependencies, external services, unapproved Capabilities or Entitlements.
- Do not merge into or modify remote `main`, force push, publish, release or tag.
- Do not use Owner data for destructive testing.
- Do not claim Owner-deferred physical-device validation or the formal 30-day observation is complete.

## Success Criteria

- S1–S10 meet their technical Exit Criteria with coherent Stage commits.
- Milestone A, B and C gates and independent internal reviews are complete.
- Final build, automated tests, simulator critical paths and isolated Export / Import recovery pass.
- Final current-context documents accurately describe a clean V1 Candidate at the Owner Review boundary.

## Current Boundary

Program Startup is complete once the independent startup state Commit is created and the working tree is clean. No S1 product code has been modified before that Commit.

After the startup Commit, begin S1 and continue autonomously through S10 unless a Mandatory Escalation condition occurs.
