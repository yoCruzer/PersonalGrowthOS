## Superseded Build 7 Boundary

- Weekly Review prompts remain visible with both empty and saved answers, while existing baseline-driven Save, Search and canonical-week behavior remain unchanged.
- Record is the third native tab. The AppShell floating capture overlay is removed; Record preserves an unsaved tab-switch draft, resets after save and routes the saved Entry to Timeline.
- Today repeatable Habit controls have a lighter 34-point visual capsule inside separate 44-point +/- targets, with uncapped `current / target` display.
- Multiple-per-day Habit create/update validation requires a positive Daily Target in the shared domain/service path. The editor suggests 2 for a new multiple mode; legacy targetless data remains readable and usable until edited.
- Archived Habits are excluded from the default main list, have a counted Archived destination and preserve existing Restore/detail/history behavior.
- SwiftData remains V7, backup remains v3, marketing version remains 1.0 and Debug/Release build number is 7.
- Backup import now preserves an explicit legacy multiple-per-day nil target while continuing to reject a provided non-positive target; Weekly Review persistent prompts are also exposed as matching accessibility labels.

## Build 8 Draft Review Boundary

- V8 persistence models, Local Day write semantics, plan/lifecycle history, a pure analytics engine and v4 transfer fields are implemented in staged commits; the complete automated acceptance matrix and UI validation pass.
- The recovered Stage 0 batch makes positive persisted Local Day authoritative for once/day duplicate, Today completion and decrement behavior; false logs no longer block true completion, rest-day activity remains factual without becoming expected, and Sunday uses the documented weekday identity.
- The exact-`95076bf` V7 fixture rejected the direct-`HabitLog`-column design with an unknown model-version error. V8 now uses additive `HabitLogDayMetadata`; representative Entry/Image/Habit/HabitLog/Goal/links/Weight/WeeklyReview facts survive overlay, idempotent bootstrap and reopen.
- `HabitPlan` and `HabitPlanRevision` now persist explicit `recordingMode`; weekly once/day credits distinct LocalDays, weekly multiple/day may credit repeated same-day activity, Tracking Only retains its mode, and backup v4 validates and round-trips the field.
- Today, Habits Overview, Habit Detail and check-in validation now resolve settings from the Plan effective on the relevant Local Day. Legacy `HabitConfiguration` is consulted only if no effective Plan exists; contradictory configuration no longer changes V8 runtime behavior.
- Name-only saves carry no Plan change and preserve pending revision IDs. The editor loads and labels a pending Plan/effective date; an actual Plan edit removes the never-effective pending revision before inserting its replacement.
- Current adherence, consistency and streaks use only the current contiguous Plan/lifecycle segment. Day→week→day, week→month→week, Tracking Only→daily and pause/complete/archive restart boundaries no longer bridge metrics.
- Local Day parsing rejects impossible dates and preserves leap days; backdated positives recompute history. Migration uses a hidden baseline with known current status and a conservative Plan boundary. Resume, Restart and Restore are distinct, same-day lifecycle ordering is deterministic, and visible Plan/lifecycle Journey facts are merged chronologically.
- Overview and Detail now share one authoritative analytics snapshot. Overview reports daily/weekly/monthly/tracking-only progress without a fake denominator; Detail leads with current progress, state and check-in actions, then shows the dashboard, five recent facts and a complete history route.
- Daily Progress uses a full civil-month calendar with scheduled success/miss/open/rest, lifecycle-neutral, pre-coverage and future states. Weekly/monthly current activity remains period-scoped and Year Activity remains a separate 365-day view.
- Daily weekday patterns display achieved/eligible success rates using only strict scheduled outcomes. Weekly, monthly and Tracking Only patterns display factual activity counts by weekday and are explicitly labeled as a distribution.
- Backup validation rejects schema-v1/v2/v3 packages carrying v4-only Plan/lifecycle payloads, while supported old packages remain compatible and v4 recording modes remain validated. Dashboard strings, streak units and Journey events now have English and Simplified Chinese coverage verified in compiled catalogs and live UI.
- Overview counters use Habit-scoped accessibility identities. Normal rows retain compact side-by-side rhythm; accessibility sizes place the action below full-width content. Mixed once/day, target-based multiple, Tracking Only, adjacent multiple rows, over-target values and a long name pass enabled semantic accessibility audits with >=44-point +/- targets in Light and Dark.
- The exact Build 8 implementation state and remaining work are recorded in `Docs/BUILD8_HABIT_ANALYTICS.md`.
- This is a Draft review candidate: the complete automated gate and remote handoff are complete. Owner physical-device validation remains mandatory before approval, merge, archive or TestFlight distribution.

## Historical Build 7 Validation Evidence

- Habit Unit: 29/29 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-Habit2.xcresult`.
- Record tab and repeatable-counter UI smoke: 2/2 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-UI.xcresult`.
- Weekly Review persistent-prompt/save/relaunch UI smoke: 1/1 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-WeeklyUI2.xcresult`.
- Final Simulator Debug build: PASS.
- `git diff --check` and String Catalog JSON parse: PASS.
- P1 import-compatibility closure: 5/5 focused Import/Export and Habit tests PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-PR4-ImportCompatibility.xcresult`.

## Remaining Owner Device Validation

- Five native tabs and no floating capture control during keyboard input.
- Record draft persistence across tab switches and clean state after save.
- Today once/multiple Habit visual row parity, long names, Dynamic Type, light/dark appearance and non-overlapping +/- touch regions.
- Daily Target editing, target overrun and legacy targetless Habit editing.
- Weekly Review Chinese prompt hierarchy, input, save confirmation and relaunch persistence.
- Habit Archive → Archived → Restore navigation with preserved history.

## Next Action

Review Draft PR [#5](https://github.com/yoCruzer/PersonalGrowthOS/pull/5) and run the Build 8 Owner physical-device checklist. Do not approve/merge, archive or publish TestFlight until that external validation is explicitly completed.
