| Status | NOT READY FOR REVIEW |
| Execution branch | `feature/build8-habit-analytics-dashboard` |
| Base | `95076bf5c2a86122fbd327903d80bccdfb8c768d` |
| Implementation tip | Current/pending Plan editing is verified; next batch is contiguous analytics segments |

| External status | No Build 8 PR, merge, archive or TestFlight action |

## Superseded Build 7 Boundary

- Weekly Review prompts remain visible with both empty and saved answers, while existing baseline-driven Save, Search and canonical-week behavior remain unchanged.
- Record is the third native tab. The AppShell floating capture overlay is removed; Record preserves an unsaved tab-switch draft, resets after save and routes the saved Entry to Timeline.
- Today repeatable Habit controls have a lighter 34-point visual capsule inside separate 44-point +/- targets, with uncapped `current / target` display.
- Multiple-per-day Habit create/update validation requires a positive Daily Target in the shared domain/service path. The editor suggests 2 for a new multiple mode; legacy targetless data remains readable and usable until edited.
- Archived Habits are excluded from the default main list, have a counted Archived destination and preserve existing Restore/detail/history behavior.
- SwiftData remains V7, backup remains v3, marketing version remains 1.0 and Debug/Release build number is 7.
- Backup import now preserves an explicit legacy multiple-per-day nil target while continuing to reject a provided non-positive target; Weekly Review persistent prompts are also exposed as matching accessibility labels.

## Build 8 In-progress Boundary

- V8 persistence models, Local Day write semantics, plan/lifecycle history, a pure analytics engine and v4 transfer fields are implemented in staged commits; acceptance-matrix and UI validation remain.
- The recovered Stage 0 batch makes positive persisted Local Day authoritative for once/day duplicate, Today completion and decrement behavior; false logs no longer block true completion, rest-day activity remains factual without becoming expected, and Sunday uses the documented weekday identity.
- The exact-`95076bf` V7 fixture rejected the direct-`HabitLog`-column design with an unknown model-version error. V8 now uses additive `HabitLogDayMetadata`; representative Entry/Image/Habit/HabitLog/Goal/links/Weight/WeeklyReview facts survive overlay, idempotent bootstrap and reopen.
- `HabitPlan` and `HabitPlanRevision` now persist explicit `recordingMode`; weekly once/day credits distinct LocalDays, weekly multiple/day may credit repeated same-day activity, Tracking Only retains its mode, and backup v4 validates and round-trips the field.
- Today, Habits Overview, Habit Detail and check-in validation now resolve settings from the Plan effective on the relevant Local Day. Legacy `HabitConfiguration` is consulted only if no effective Plan exists; contradictory configuration no longer changes V8 runtime behavior.
- Name-only saves carry no Plan change and preserve pending revision IDs. The editor loads and labels a pending Plan/effective date; an actual Plan edit removes the never-effective pending revision before inserting its replacement.
- The exact Build 8 implementation state and remaining work are recorded in `Docs/BUILD8_HABIT_ANALYTICS.md`.
- This is not a candidate: the acceptance matrix, migration verification, UI verification, documentation closure and remote review handoff remain incomplete.

## Historical Build 7 Validation Evidence

- Habit Unit: 29/29 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-Habit2.xcresult`.
- Record tab and repeatable-counter UI smoke: 2/2 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-UI.xcresult`.
- Weekly Review persistent-prompt/save/relaunch UI smoke: 1/1 PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-WeeklyUI2.xcresult`.
- Final Simulator Debug build: PASS.
- `git diff --check` and String Catalog JSON parse: PASS.
- P1 import-compatibility closure: 5/5 focused Import/Export and Habit tests PASS — `/tmp/PersonalGrowthOS-Build7-PR4-ImportCompatibility.xcresult`.

## Remaining Owner Device Validation

- Five native tabs and no floating capture control during keyboard input.
- Record draft persistence across tab switches and clean state after save.
- Today once/multiple Habit visual row parity, long names, Dynamic Type, light/dark appearance and non-overlapping +/- touch regions.
- Daily Target editing, target overrun and legacy targetless Habit editing.
- Weekly Review Chinese prompt hierarchy, input, save confirmation and relaunch persistence.
- Habit Archive → Archived → Restore navigation with preserved history.

## Next Action

Restrict adherence, consistency and streak calculations to the current contiguous comparable Plan segment so day→week→day and week→month→week cannot bridge across the intervening semantics. Do not open a Draft PR until the complete Build 8 gate passes. Do not merge, archive or publish TestFlight.
